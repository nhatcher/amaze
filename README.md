A MAZE
======

This is a simple maze game. You can play it here <https://nhatcher.github.io/amaze/>.

This is a javascript/HTML port of a very old game I did in C back in ~1990.

It uses a _recursive backtracker algorithm_ as in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm>. Of course back then I had no idea what that was.

I had just finished reading Roger Penrose's [_The new emperor's mind_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind) and I was crazy about AI.
I wanted to create a computer program that was able to create things. Somehow me and my friend Iv√°n came up with this shit.

I felt pretty proud at the time...
